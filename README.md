# Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Q3_202_Analysis
This analysis is a case study from Google Data Analytics Certificate course. In this project, I will be merging datasets from July, August and September 2020 to get a single dataset for Q3 2020, conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question "In what ways do member and casual riders use cyclistic bikes differently?".
